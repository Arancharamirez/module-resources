**Command Window**, on this panel you can enter commands and interact with variables in real-time. This panel is where most of the action will happen!

**Workspace**, on this panel you can see all your declared variables, their type and their value.

## Declaring variables and basic operations
### Declare variables
The following command will create a variable called **a** with the value of 34
```matlab:Code
a = 34
```
Many more variables can be created
```matalb:Code
b = 21
```
These variables can be used to create new variables!
```matlab:Code
c = a + b
c =
    55
```
### Basic Operators
- Addition "+"
- Substraction "-"
- Multiplication "*"
- Division "/"

These can be used to create all sort of operations:
```matlab:Code
d = (a * b)/c
d = 
    12.9818
```

### Useful information
- If you finish your command with a **";"** the result will not be displayed.
- When Matlab does an operation without declaring a variable, the result gets stored in a variable called **ans**, exactly like physical calculators do!

```matlab:Code
45 - 67
ans = 
    -22
```

- Pressing the **up and down arrows** on the command line will allow you to "recall" commands, give this a try!
- Press **tab** to autocomplete commands.
