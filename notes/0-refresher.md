# Chapter 0 - Refresher
This chapter is meant to serve as a high-speed reminder of a few concepts from high school
which you will need to progress with this course. Some of you may have forgotten (or even
never known) some of this material; however, if you let anyone from the teaching team know
this, then Iâ€™m sure we can get you up to speed in no time! :-) <br>

## <a id="algebra"></a>0.1 Algebra
<br>

You will all be familiar with the core idea of algebra, which is that you can represent numbers and concepts (like functions) with symbols. This is very powerful as it allows you to move away from discussing specific cases and instead describe generalised ideas. For example, if I say that the speed of a cylinder rolling down a hill is $v$, its rotational speed is $\omega$, and its radius is $r$; then by considering a bit of geometry, I can write down the relation $v=\omega r$ and this will be true for many different combinations of these three parameters. Fun fact: the word ``algebra'' comes from the Arabic ``al-jabr'' which means ``the reunion of broken parts''; bonus fact, the word ``algorithm'' comes from the name of a specific 8$^{th}$ century Persian mathematician called  Al-Khwarizi.
<br><br>
Algebra is at the heart of much of what we do in mathematics and I'm sure you will have done plenty of it at high school. However, for this course I am much more interested in you developing strong mathematical intuition than being masters of grinding through long algebra problems.<br><br>

To a great extent, computers have taken over most of the mathematical tasks that engineers were once expected to do; however, you still need to know the key ideas in order to take advantage of the computer's power (and to know what to do when the computer gets stuck). You'll also need to know how to manipulate algebraic expressions, using tools such as Partial Fractions (see table), algebraic long division or simultaneous equations.

## <a id="calculus"></a>0.2 Calculus
We will be using calculus in almost every topic in this module, so it seems sensible for us to start with a quick refresher. However, I won't be expecting you to remember lots of tricky substitutions and identities because, since the advent of the internet, these have turned out to not be very useful things to know. Instead, what we'll be focusing on is the core understanding behind each topic, which will hopefully give you mathematical confidence, without being too dull.

If you are given the graph of a linear function (\ie $f(x)=ax+b$ in the adjacent figure), you can calculate the slope by simply drawing a right-angle triangle and then calculating the ratio of the vertical to the horizontal lines (\ie rise over run or ''RoR''). You can perform this operation anywhere along the line because this function has a constant gradient, but what do we do if our function's gradient is variable?
<br><br>
For the general function $f(x)$, the ''gradient'' at a point is the slope of the curve at that point. In the figure below, we're looking for the gradient of the black line at point $x_0$ (the red point). To apply the RoR approach again, we must pick another point further along the $x$-axis, which we will call $(x_0+\Delta x)$. However, as you can see from the figure, the line passing through these two points is not a great approximation to the slope at $x_0$.
