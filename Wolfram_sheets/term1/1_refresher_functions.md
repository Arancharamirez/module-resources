# Refresher and Functions

 [<= Back to the Cheatsheet](../WolframCheatsheet.md)

 **IMPORTANT** You will need to have a [WolframAlpha Pro account](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/admin-services/ict/self-service/computers-printing/devices-and-software/get-software/get-software-for-students/wolfram-alpha-pro/) to use Wolfram effectively.

 ## Basic Algebra
 WolframAlpha is a really powerful tool for algebra. Most of the learning you do won't be through these sheets (because there is too much to teach), but through playing around with it and seeing what happens.

 Wolfram is incredibly powerful: you can ask it anything. You can speak to it in English, and it will reply with maths. Try asking Wolfram to [split a fraction into partial fractions](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%285x-4%29%2F%28x%5E2-x-2%29+partial+fraction). It really is as simple as writing ```(your-fraction) partial fraction``` into the search bar.

 If you want it to solve a quadratic, you don't even need to ask the question: just type any equation, e.g. ```x^2 + 17x + 12 = 3``` and it'll work out what you want. It will even graph the equation (useful for curve sketching).

 ## Functions
 Wolfram has it's [own documentation](https://www.wolframalpha.com/examples/mathematics/mathematical-functions/).

 ### Plotting
 Literally just type ```plot```. [Here](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=plot+y%3De%5E-x+and+y%3Dcos%28pi+x%29+and+y%3Dcos%28pi+x%29+e%5E-x+for+0%3Cx%3C5) we are plotting two functions and their product, all on the same axes.

 ### Rational Functions & Limits
 We can plot composite functions, made up of one function / another function. [Here](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=y%3D%28x%5E2-3x%2B2%29+and+y%3D%282x-5%29+and+y%3D%28x%5E2-3x%2B2%29%2F%282x-5%29+for+0%3Cx%3C4+and+-3%3Cy%3C3) we plot two functions as well as one / the other, and impose limits on the plot.

 Note that the roots of the numerator are still roots of the function and roots of the denominator result in an asymptote. We can ask Wolfram to [plot these asymptotes](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=asymptotes+y%3D%28x%5E2-3x%2B2%29%2F%282x-5%29), too.

 We can use these techniques to visualise functions: plotting them is an extremely useful tool.

 ## Side note on Desmos
 Desmos is an excellent graphing calculator alternative to Wolfram (for graphical things). [Here](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/i2vscwbc1o) is an example Desmos graph - you can see how this could be extremely useful, especially for curve identification. Using the sliders on the left-hand side, you can change the parameters, and thus the shape, of the function.
