# Vectors

 [<= Back to the Cheatsheet](../WolframCheatsheet.md)

 **IMPORTANT** You will need to have a [WolframAlpha Pro account](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/admin-services/ict/self-service/computers-printing/devices-and-software/get-software/get-software-for-students/wolfram-alpha-pro/) to use Wolfram effectively.

 Wolfram has it's [own documentation](https://www.wolframalpha.com/examples/mathematics/linear-algebra/vectors/).

 ### Displaying
 Typing ```vector``` into the search bar followed by your vector in ```Xi+Yj``` notation will have it [displayed](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=vector+2i+-+4j+%2B+2k+and+3i+%2B3j). They are displayed in coordinate geometry as linear combinations of unit vectors. It also suggests more information like their lengths and normalized vectors. 

 You can use the same ```and``` notation as with functions to display more than one vector, as in the above link.

 Vector addition is as simple as putting a + between two vectors: ```vector (2i - 4j + 2k) + (3i +3j)``` . You can [omit](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=vector+%282%2C-4%2C2%29+%2B+%283%2C3%2C0%29) or [include](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=vector+%282i+-+4j+%2B+2k%29+%2B+%283i+%2B3j%29) the coordinate notation.

 ### Products
 Dot and cross products are as simple as writing ```(your-vector-1).(your-vector-2)``` or ```(your-vector-1) dot (your-vector-2)```, and ```(your-vector-1)x(your-vector-2)``` or ```(your-vector-1) cross (your-vector-2)```. For the cross product you can visualize the resulting vector, which is normal to the plane describe for the vectors that are multiplied. 

 For the [triple scalar product](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%283i-2j%2B4k%29x%285i-4j-2k%29.%282i-2j-8k%29) (e.g. to find the volume of a parallelpiped), you have to do the operations seperately - but they can be in the same query.

### Describe a line
Select a initial point, the line direction, and a scalar parameter. The [resulting vector](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%283i-2j%2B4k%29+%2B+2*%285i-4j-2k%29) describes a point belonging to the line. Here there is a link to a Wolfram demonstration that may help you to visualize the concept of a [line described by vectors](https://demonstrations.wolfram.com/EquationOfALineInVectorForm2D/).

### Describe a plane
Using vectors to describe a plane - select a initial point, two line directions, and two scalar parameters. The [resulting vector](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%283i-2j%2B4k%29+%2B+2*%285i-4j-2k%29+%2B3*%28i%2Bj%2B2k%29) describes a point belonging to the plane. Here there is a link to a Wolfram demonstration that may help you to visualize the concept of a [plane described by vectors](https://demonstrations.wolfram.com/EquationOfAPlane/).

 ### Closest Approach
 While you can't calculate the closest approach of two vector lines directly in WolframAlpha, there are some great resources for this out there. For example, the [Keisan](https://keisan.casio.com/exec/system/1223531414) calculator will tell you the closest distance between two vector lines you input.
