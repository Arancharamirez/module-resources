# Refresher and Functions

[<= Back to the Cheatsheet](../WolframCheatsheet.md)

**IMPORTANT** You will need to have a [WolframAlpha Pro account](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/admin-services/ict/self-service/computers-printing/devices-and-software/get-software/get-software-for-students/wolfram-alpha-pro/) to use Wolfram effectively.

## Vectors
Wolfram has it's [own documentation](https://www.wolframalpha.com/examples/mathematics/linear-algebra/vectors/).

### Displaying
Typing ```vector``` into the search bar followed by your vector in ```Xi+Yj``` notation will have it [displayed](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=vector+2i+-+4j+%2B+2k+and+3i+%2B3j).

You can use the same ```and``` notation as with functions to display more than one vector, as in the above link.

Vector addition is as simple as putting a + between two vectors: ```vector (2i - 4j + 2k) + (3i +3j)```

### Products
Dot and cross products are as simple as writing ```(your-vector-1).(your-vector-2)``` or ```(your-vector-1) dot (your-vector-2)```, and ```(your-vector-1)x(your-vector-2)``` or ```(your-vector-1) cross (your-vector-2)```.

For the [triple scalar product](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%283i-2j%2B4k%29x%285i-4j-2k%29.%282i-2j-8k%29) (e.g. to find the volume of a parallelpiped), you have to do the operations seperately - but they can be in the same query.

### Closest Approach
While you can't calculate the closest approach of two vector lines directly in WolframAlpha, there are some great resources for this out there. For example, the [Keisan](https://keisan.casio.com/exec/system/1223531414) calculator will tell you the closesd distance between two vector lines you input.
