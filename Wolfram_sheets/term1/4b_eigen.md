# Eigenproblems & Eigen Analysis

[<= Back to the Cheatsheet](../WolframCheatsheet.md)

**IMPORTANT** You will need to have a [WolframAlpha Pro account](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/admin-services/ict/self-service/computers-printing/devices-and-software/get-software/get-software-for-students/wolfram-alpha-pro/) to use Wolfram effectively.

Eigenproblems rely very heavily on handling [matrices](./matrices.md).

### Eigenvectors
You can very easily ask Wolfram for the `eigenvectors` of a matrix, simply by typing the word in front of your matrix, like [this](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=eigenvectors+%7B%7B1%2C+0%2C+0%7D%2C+%7B0%2C+0%2C+1%7D%2C+%7B0%2C+1%2C+0%7D%7D&lk=3).

## Eigenvalues
Much like eigenvectors, you can use the `eigenvalues` keyword to have Wolfram [calculate](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=eigenvalues+%7B%7B4%2C+1%7D%2C+%7B2%2C+-1%7D%7D) the eigenvalues.

Use this alongside linear transformations to visually understand eigenvectors and corresponding eigenvalues.
