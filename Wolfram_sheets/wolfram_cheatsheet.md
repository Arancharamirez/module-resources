# Wolfram Alpha Cheatsheet


### Getting Started with Wolfram Alpha

Because [WolframAlpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com) is basically a search engine, it is one of the easier tools to start using.

#### Creating your Account
It's important to create an account with your Imperial email so that you get (free!) access to Pro Computing Time (which means Wolfram tries harder to answer your question before giving up).

To sign up, you first have to create a Wolfram account [here](https://account.wolfram.com/auth/create). Again, use your **long form** imperial email address, i.e. ```name.surname21@imperial.ac.uk```.

Once you've done that, you can request access to Pro Unlimited [here](https://user.wolfram.com/portal/requestAK/e644bf3e2cf8d5afdf8bbbde53ce36b7b6b6a917).

If either of these two links are broken, Imperial has its own page on how to get set up [here](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/admin-services/ict/self-service/computers-printing/devices-and-software/get-software/get-software-for-students/wolfram-alpha-pro/).
